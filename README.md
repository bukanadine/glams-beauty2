> You are extending the existing **Glams Beauty** website from Homework 1 into **Homework 2** using **AdonisJS** and **Edge Template Engine**.
>
> Keep the same Glams Beauty theme, colors, and design from Homework 1, but now structure the project using Edge templates and local SQLite database.
>
> Implement two main roles:
> **1. User (Customer)**
>
> * Home page showing branding and tagline
> * Search page to find beauty products
> * Product detail page with name, price, description, image
> * Wishlist page to add and view saved items
> * Contact page with basic info or message form
>
> **2. Seller (Admin)**
>
> * Dashboard page listing all products
> * Add product page (name, price, image, description)
> * Wishlist viewer page to see what users saved
>
> Requirements:
>
> * Use **Edge Template Engine** with a reusable `layout.edge` for header, body, and footer.
> * Use **pure CSS styling** (no Tailwind) linked via `/public/css/style.css`.
> * Use **SQLite** for storing products and wishlists (can start with dummy data).
> * Maintain clean folder structure under `resources/views/user` and `resources/views/seller`.
> * Generate all needed routes, controllers, and Edge templates automatically.
>
> Output: Complete AdonisJS + Edge project for **Glams Beauty**, based on the existing design from HW1, following Homework 2 requirements.
